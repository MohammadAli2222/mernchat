# Chat Application 

Full Stack Chatting App.

## TechStack:
	• In my chat application, I used MongoDB to store chat messages and user information. 
	• Express.js was used to build the backend server, handle API requests, and implement authentication and authorization. 
	• React was used to develop the frontend user interface, including components for displaying chats, user lists, and user authentication. 
    Node.js was used as the server runtime to execute JavaScript code on the server-side.
